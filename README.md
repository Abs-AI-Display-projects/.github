**Display Projects and Repositories:**
 
In this section, we display a sample of the apps developed by The App Dev Team at Abs.AI. 

⛔ _NB. In this project, we display samples of our work, not the full projects. The samples are taken from real-life applications developed and delivered by our team with the consent and knowledge of the projects' owners. To clarify, each repository attached to this project is not a fully functioning project on its own but rather a module, service, or display sheet from a previously delivered project._
